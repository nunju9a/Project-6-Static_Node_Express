# Project-6_Static_Node_Express

In this project, I created a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page where I share contact info, give an elevator pitch and talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages that show off and detail my first five projects from this Techdegree.

Aiming for exceeds expectations:

-error.pug created
-npm start runs app.js

-Changed body background color to red in CSS
-Changed live demo/github links to transform scale 1.10 in CSS
-Added athena logo to layout
