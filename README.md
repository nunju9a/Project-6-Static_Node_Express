# Static Node.js and Express Site 
- Received grade of "Exceeds Expectations"

In this project, I created a portfolio site to showcase the projects I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page where I share contact info, give an elevator pitch and talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages that show off and detail my first five projects from this Techdegree.

Working with node.js for the first time, I set up a server using Express. Routes are set up with middleware and pug templates are used to render pages. 

To start this site you must run npm install in the terminal and then npm start.
